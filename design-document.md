## One-page design document

**A dude just wants to live.**

**A 3D tamagotchi chat bot with a bizarre sense of humor.**

**A modern twist on tamagotchi. You feed and raise your dude, then set him free.**

### Design Pillars:

ist up to 3 words/phrases that convey the feeling or emotion you want the player to experience. (Example: *Fast. Action-packed. Mayhem.*)

**Provocative. Poetic. Deliberate and slow paced.**

### Interface:
List the player input method, the controls, and how the player interacts with your game.

* Command Line Interface / Keys

* Simple natural language

* A fully fleshed out, walking/talking character. (reads, writes, responds, obviously software, but oddly human)

* victorian talking dolls creepy
* pull the string:theres a snake in my boot (toy story)
